          Welcome to Cherish Birth! I'm passionate about mums and their
          partners being educated, informed, supported and loved throughout the
          journey of pregnancy, labour, birth &amp; parenting. I know it can be
          overwhelming, but truly believe that with the right support team you will
          have a birth that you can be at peace about.
