      A doula is a qualified, non-medical support person who will be with you
      throughout your whole labour and birth. We provide information and support
      to parents during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period.
    </p>
    <p>
      A doula believes in the process of birth, and is aware of the impact that
      it can have on parenting. A doula is educated in comfort measures such as
      positioning, hot packs, aromas, relaxation techniques, massage and
      managing labour sensations with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Doula, I will not impose my own thoughts or beliefs onto a client. I
      am always respectful, understanding, and a great listener. I acknowledge
      the power of birth and believe it is a non-medical event, unless the woman
      asks for assistance for her or her baby. I know that dim lighting always
      makes a difference, and that the fewer people interrupting the woman and
      the process, the quicker the birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will offer continuous support, I will trust the woman's instincts and I
      understand that birth is a rite of passage and it is a woman's right to
      birth her baby how, where and with whom she chooses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Doula I do not perform medical or clinical tasks, I do not diagnose,
      offer second opinions or give medical advice. I am trained and skilled in
      supporting the birthing woman and her partner through childbirth, one
      contraction at a time. I can support you at home (with private midwives),
      in a birth centre, a labour ward or a private hospital.
