She has a passion to see the current culture of birth changed, for families to own their birth and for the rates of birth trauma to be reduced. Alyssa is passionate about seeing people loved, cherished and to have a sense of belonging.</p><h3>Why Alyssa became a Doula</h3><p>Alyssa has always had a passion for mums and babies, this became even stronger after the birth of her daughter. She was shocked at how disconnected she felt from her care providers and how much information she had to source for herself that really should have been coming from them. Alyssa had a beautiful birth, but it made her wonder, are other women getting enough information to have a birth experience that they are at peace with? Once she started researching options, she came across Doulaâ€™s and the work they do, the service they can provide to families. She knew that was it!</p></div><p><a class="btn btn-block" href="mailto:hello@cherishbirth.com.au?subject=Hello"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-fw fa-at"></i> hello@cherishbirth.com.au </a><a class="btn btn-block" href="https://instagram.com/cherish_birth/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-fw fa-instagram"></i> cherish_birth</a></p></div><script src="/scripts.min.js?v=a9e8a44efe82752ec4e36923b618c99f"></script></body></html>
