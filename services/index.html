We discuss your ideal birth and how to map out your birth preferences. You and your birth partner can attend a group class at Illawarra Birth Classes to help you gain understanding of the physiological birth preferences, interventions, pain relief options and a wide range of support techniques your support team can use, should you want it. We also plan for your Fourth Trimester, discussing meals, support, recovery and all aspects of health.</p><p>You and I can meet in those last few days of your pregnancy, for a coffee or a walk, or even just a pep talk.</p><p>I am on call for you from 37 weeks, day and night I am available. I can come and support you at home and/or hospital and I usually stay for around 2 hours after bub has arrived to take photos, videos, assist with any breastfeeding questions, making sure parents have some food & drink and making sure everyone is settled before I leave.</p><p>I will come to your home for 3 postnatal visits. During these visits we can debrief your birth, get you comfortable with babywearing, l can provide you with a list of local resources you might need or want, support around breastfeeding and normal biological infant sleep and safe sleeping options.</p><p>Working together throughout your pregnancy, birth and postpartum to set you up for a positive start to parenthood.</p><h3>Babywearing one hour session &mdash; $60</h3><p>Are you confused about the different types of babywearing carriers?
